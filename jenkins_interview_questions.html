<h1>Q1. What is Jenkins?</h1>
<h1>Jenkins is an open source automation tool written in Java with plugins built for Continuous Integration purpose. Jenkins is used to build and test your software projects continuously making it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh build. It also allows you to continuously deliver your software by integrating with a large number of testing and deployment technologies.

Once you have defined Jenkins give an example, you can refer the below mentioned use case:

First, a developer commits the code to the source code repository. Meanwhile, the Jenkins server checks the repository at regular intervals for changes.
Soon after a commit occurs, the Jenkins server detects the changes that have occurred in the source code repository. Jenkins will pull those changes and will start preparing a new build.
If the build fails, then the concerned team will be notified.
If built is successful, then Jenkins deploys the built in the test server.
After testing, Jenkins generates a feedback and then notifies the developers about the build and test results.
It will continue to check the  source code repository for changes made in the source code and the whole process keeps on repeating.</h1>
